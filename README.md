Description: 
Welcome to the Shapeless Dungeon! Your goal is too reach the final gate and step deeper into this dreadful dungeon. Press Z, Q, S and D or use your keyboard arrows to move around. 

You will have to pass through a number of checkpoints before going to the final door. Step on the different checkpoints, following their specific order and get to the final stairs. 

You can sprint using the Shift key. You will run faster but your stamina will lower. Use it wisely! 

This creepy dungeon is cursed. A mighty wizard put a powerful spell on it which makes the shape of the dungeon shift without stopping. Some part of the dungeon will disappear, some more will appear. Avoid the disappearing parts or your soul will be sent to the Dark Void! 

This shapeless dungeon is haunted. It is inhabited by the souls of adventurers like you. These ghosts will try to devour your soul, avoid them at all cost!
